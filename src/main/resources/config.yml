# CheezSurvTagGame Configuration

# DiscordSRV integration.
# If enabled, the plugin will send messages through DiscordSRV to the specified channel
# whenever someone is tagged by someone else or somehow set as It, whether by an admin or automatically.
discordsrv:
  enabled: false # Enable sending Discord messages? (DiscordSRV must be installed.)
  channel-name: global # Channel name specified in the DiscordSRV config.yml file. Leave as "global" if you don't know.

# When the player who is currently It is not online, the plugin will try to choose a random online player to be It.
it-reassignment:
  interval-seconds: 300 # How many seconds between attempts? Set to 0 to disable.
  min-online-players: 2 # How many players have to be online to choose a new It?.

# Under the plugin folder, data is stored under /data/TagGame.db in a SQLite database.
# This option controls whether the plugin will add new rows to the TagLog table in this
# database whenever a player is tagged.
#
# The plugin does not currently use this data in any way, and it's not need for it to function.
# This feature exists for if you want to export the logs as a spreadsheet later on and calculate
# for how long each player was it or something like that.
